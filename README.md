# Vial Calculator Assignment

This repo contains codes for both front-end and back-end of the calculator. This application is hosted at [vial-calculator](http://vial-calculator-frontend.s3-website-sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/) in AWS. A documentation on the architecture is provided [here](https://github.com/Johnvanazzi/vial-calculator/blob/main/Vial%20SWE%20Calculator%20Assignment.pdf)

# Back-end
To run the back-end locally application you just have to go to the **backend** Directory and run ```node index.js```. Note that this may not work properly since the backend tries to connect to DynamoDB inside AWS environment.

# Front-end
To run the front-end locally you have to go to the **frontend** Directory and run ```npm run start```. Note that you may have to install react-scripts or react itself on your node.
